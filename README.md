## 🖥️ Java Features Implemented
## -------------------------------

✨ Functional Decomposition: Matcha Hut uses several methods to break up classes.

✨ Looping with Repetition Control Structures: Use three kinds of loops: 
                                              -do-while loop to take multiple orders,
                                              -while loop to take input till the correct input.
                                              -for-each loop to traverse array.
  
✨ Branching with Selection Control Structures: multiple if/else statements throughout.
   Uses Switch-case for menu selection.

✨ File IO: Read menu from menu.txt file. Write all order details to order details.txt file 

✨ Using Multiple Classes: Uses 7 classes with proper methods:
                           -Matcha Hut: base class, displays menu
                           -Tea: class for teas
                           -Coffee: class for coffees
                           -OtherBeverages: class for other drinks
                           -OrderDetails: calculates all order details
                           -DisplayOrder: displays the order
                           -MatchaHutDriver: driver class for menu selection
                           
✨ Exception Handling with Try/Catch blocks: for reading from and writing to files.

✨ Class Design using Access Modifiers: Make all class-wide instance variables private in
   your class, and provide “getters” and “setters” to get and set the data accordingly.

✨ Arrays: Makes use of Arrays to check for invalid input for
           - delivery time and method
